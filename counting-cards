Count Change	Cards
+1	2, 3, 4, 5, 6
0	7, 8, 9
-1	10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'
You will write a card counting function. It will receive a card parameter, which can be a number or a string, 
and increment or decrement the global count variable according to the card's value (see table). The function 
will then return a string with the current count and the string Bet if the count is positive, or Hold if the 
count is zero or negative. The current count and the player's decision (Bet or Hold) should be separated by
a single space.

Example Output
-3 Hold
5 Bet

Hint
Do NOT reset count to 0 when value is 7, 8, or 9.
Do NOT return an array.
Do NOT include quotes (single or double) in the output.

var count = 0;

function cc(card) {
var increaseCount = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
var decreaseCount = [10, "J", "Q", "K", "A"];
if (increaseCount.includes(card)) {
  count++;
}
else if (decreaseCount.includes(card)) {
  count--;
}
var betHold;
if (count > 0){
  betHold = "Bet";
}else {
  betHold = "Hold";
}
var answer = `${count} ${betHold}`;

  return answer;
